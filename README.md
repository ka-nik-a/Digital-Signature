# Digital-Signature
Digital Signature - A digital signature helps the receiver to know the message comes from the authentic sender and is not altered in between.
 1. Generating the public and private key using RSA Algorithm (Asymmetric Algorithm), making a generate_keys function
 2. Signing the transcation by the use of private key, making a sign function and passing the transaction and the private key to that function
 3. Verification of the transaction, making a function verify and passing public key, transaction and the signature
